## Problem Statement:

⮞ In any country democratic voting is the most important event that allow its citizens to exercise their power by voting and electing their representatives. And to protect this right of the citizens, conducting fair elections is the basic prerequisite for any country. 
<br>
⮞ In a democratic system, **every vote counts**.Yet many adult citizens don't cast their votes on election day. They may be out of town or they feel that the voting center is located too far. 
<br>
⮞ Replacement of this system is necessary to limit voting frauds and to make the voting and counting processes more transparent. Further a system is required that makes voting more convenient for the voters a system that minimizes the cost of conducting elections as money spent on national elections is huge. A system which allows us to vote even when we are traveling abroad or are not present in our home state. 

## Solution:

⮞ The Online voting system tends to maximize user participation, by allowing them to vote from anywhere and allowing access from different computer systems and from any device that has an internet connection. Voting on the internet provides a safe and private channel that allows all users to participate on equal terms. 
<br>
⮞ Increased accessibility for residents abroad and for persons with difficulties in travelling or reduced mobility. This also has a positive impact on the final turnout and therefore on the legitimacy of the election. 
<br>
⮞ The reduction in organizational and implementation costs significantly increases the efficiency of election management compared to the offline voting system.

## How to get started?

⮞ Open the CMD in windows.
<br>
⮞ Change the current working directory to the location where you have the cloned directory.
<br>
⮞ Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

```sh
git clone [URL]
```

⮞ Now run `npm install` to install all the node packages.

```sh
npm install
```

⮞ And then run the following command to start the web-UI in development mode. 

```sh
nodemon app.js
```
⮞ Open ***http://localhost:3000*** to view it in the browser.
```sh
port:3000
```
